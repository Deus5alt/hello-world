developing webhooks to work with Flow for TechEZ

My goal is to be able to seamlessly integrate the various new Microsoft 365 apps so that we can track changes made to various tasks, even if the apps arent exactly supported by Microsoft Flows.  I have an uphill battle because I am more or less completely new to all of this.

Some goals to consider:

1)Learn about webhooks
2)Learn about API's
3)Learn Microsoft PowerApps
4)Master use of Flows

A)Get the Microsoft Planner to be able to trigger Flows to send notifications to admins in Teams when tasks are completed and it automatically takes files uploaded into the channel and mirrors them into SharePoint.
B)Please create Flow to automatically send an email with the link to directly access a Planner Task whenever it has been assigned to someone.
